This is a Task Assigner web application built using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

It lets you draw "lines" between columns to form a map to traverse.

Each player turns when they hit a line.

In the end, each player should have different tasks.

I coded it mostly in a day or two while being very busy, so I did not have much time
to clean the code.

Yes, I know global variables are bad. Yes, I should've used closures. Sorry :P

Enjoy!
